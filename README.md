# koRpus_for_linguistics
Using the koRpus package to get lexical diversity and readability scores.

This project aims to show how to use the koRpus package for linguistic purposes.
I've tried to keep it very simple, bearing in mind that this is not addressed to programmers,
but rather to linguists and students of linguistics who have little knowledge of R. 
Because I've been there (and I am still there!) and I know how difficult it is to start 
with R when you have no programming background, I am trying to present simple 
scripts, with basic functions and comments that may help during the first steps. 
Do feel free to contact me for any doubt, bug, problem, question... I'll be happy to help
if I can.
